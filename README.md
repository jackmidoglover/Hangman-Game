# Hangman-Game

This repository is for a Norwegian Black Metal style Hangman game that allows users to press keys on their keyboard to guess the name of a 
Norwegian Black Metal Band. The user is given 12 guesses. If they use up all 12 guesses the user loses the game. If the user successfully 
guesses the name of the band, their score is increased by 1. 

Clicking anywhere on the page after a win will refresh the game for a second round. 

# How it Works

The project works by using two primary functions: reset() which pushes game values like the band name chosen and guesses remaining to the 
global game variables. hangman() runs the actual game when the user presses a key. 

# Who can use this project
This project is available for anyone to add to or contribute. 

# Project Goal
The goal is to create a fun hangman style game with a Norwegian Black Metal theme!

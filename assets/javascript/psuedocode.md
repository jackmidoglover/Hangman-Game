    the instructions
    Wins counter
    the current word

    number of guesses remaining
    letters guessed

3. When the page loads, the computer must pick a word from the array, and
generate the appropriate number of _s.

4. An event listener for a key being pressed which then: 
    adds the letter to the word bank of letters guessed
    adds the letter to the current word if it is part of the current word
    deducts from number of guesses remaining if it is not part of the current word
    & if the same key is pressed twice, it doesn't deduct or add the letter

5. some kind of conditional that ends the game as a loss when the guesses run out
6. some kind of conditional that takes the user to a winning screen if the word is 
guessed& plays music
